To run my code, 

>>> python MC_paper.py

This will plot 3 plots. One of flux plotted against energy. It plots the 
dilution methods along with ultrafine for comparison. 

It'll also plot the same thing, but with another slab width alongside it. 

We'll print out the computed subgroup result, along with Carlvik against 
Dancoff
