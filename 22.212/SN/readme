Using SN method code

>>> python slab.py

You can run either the slab code for plotting fluxes (for uniform slab or for 
the heterogeneous problem defined in the problem statement), or you can track
how the errors change for various cell spacings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To look at the flux, go into the top of ``slab.py'' and make sure that 

  flux = True

this will use the numbers of cells that you specify using numCells (up at the
top too). 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To look at the error, go into the top of ``slab.py'' and make sure that 

  error = True



Having 

  uniform = True

means that we're modeling the uniform problem. Having it false means we're doing
the half-geometry with reflective bounds heterogeneous problem.
