To run my code, 
>>> python moc.py keff 
will run MOC and show the k values plotted over the different iterations.

>>> python moc.py diagram
will plot the rays in the diagram with the nice rays included.

iteration. If you want to change that, the variables to do so are living around 
line 15

Here's a bit of a layout of your code.
